            <span id="cringeOMeter">Cringe-o-Meter: 23% (safe)</span>
            <p>Disitus is the primary world and in the center of the JV universe. Disitus is primarily populated by simple, figure-like geometric people like stick figures and the like. The entire world is extremely vibrant and colorful like something straight out of a children's cartoon.</p>

                <h1>Locations</h1>
                <h2>Disitus City</h2>
                <p>Disitus City is a huge, huge city similar to New Orleans. Full of large towers and more roads than a man could hope to ride in his lifetime. The city has never been in any wars or conflict and is merely here to stay and serve with its motto "We are not to offend nor are we here to harm, we are merely here to sit for good. No man harmed, no man served, neutral at most."</p>
                <p>Disitus City doesn't have much history to their names because of their "old stump that's been there forever but nobody has moved nor does anyone care to" mindest. It was founded by Jin Afunckle and started as just some run-of-the-mill everyday suburb with a population of ~230-213 after 3 years.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, as communities do, they expanded the place and the rest is history (literally) (can't be bothered to write any more)</p>
                <h2>Greater Disitus</h2>
                <p>[REDACTED BY GREATER DISITUS BECAUSE THE PAGE SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT THEM AND THEIR GOVERNMENT]</p>
                <h2>The Desert</h2>
                <p>The Desert is a massive stretch of desert that takes up 1/4 of the entire planet and is mostly uninhabitable. Nothing much more to say about it other than that it turned into a desert only recently due to climate change (e.g. unregulated super duper mess-up-the-planet heaters)</p>
                <h3>The Monolith</h3>
                <p>The Monolith is a gigantic 200,500 square mile stretch of land that was randomly lifted up a quarter mile as if a tectonic plate was randomly ejected upward, leaving a massive wall of stone protruding upward with regular terrain on the top. All other information has been classified for unknown reasons.</p>
