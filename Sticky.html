        <h1>001 - Sticky</h1>
        <span class="CringeOMeter">Cringe-O-Meter: 20% (minimal chances of cringe)</span>
        <p>Sticky is a very... interesting character. They've never had a very defined... anything? It's like they've existed alongside, maybe even before Wazefuk was a character, but they've just... never been fleshed out? Strange. I guess there's no better time to actually define them then in an encyclopedia of which they're the second entry!</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Sticky, as you could've guessed by the name, is a stick figure. A tall line for a torso, two arms with two lines for each that connect to form an elbow, same for the legs with two lines for each leg that connect to form a knee. They have two smaller lines to represent feel. They have no hands (but can still hold, grab, whatever you could do with hands). Their head is simply a circle on the top of their torso with a face identical to Wazefuk's.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Sticky is a very laid-back person. They only really take much seriously when there's actual stakes at hand (e.g. the TV's broken), otherwise just exists pleasantly. They're like that one NPC in a video game that just leans against a table or wall while smiling smugly and shares occasional witty one-liners with the player.</p>
        <p>When Sticky does on occasion snap out of their daydream mode, they're quite a cool person, using their somehow obtained college-level expertise in every concievable subject to get Wazefuk and the Gang out of whatever conundrum is at hand.</p>
        <h2>Powers</h2>
        <p>Sticky has seemingly infinite knowledge about every concievable subject. However, this does not translate into intelligence because he still struggles with basic algebra (Baldi would not approve). Sticky has rarely ever used this so the TCDA group does not have much more to write about.</p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sticky is 5'11"</li>
            <li>Sticky and Wazefuk are cousins, and, despite that, he did not inherit any sort of godhood</li>
            <li>Sticky has a hobby in poetry</li>
            <li>Sticky's bones are made of lead. Why? A better question is why not?</li>
            <li>Sticky doesn't particularly like his name but there's currently no legal process in Disitus to change your name and everybody refuses to call him anything else so he's just stuck with it...</li>
        </ol>
