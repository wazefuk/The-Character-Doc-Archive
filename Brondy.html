        <h1>002 - Brondy</h1>
        <span class="CringeOMeter">Cringe-O-Meter - 49% (moderate amounts of embarrassment)</span>
        <p>Brondy is a rather interesting fellow... They're like the "I'm not like other kids" of Disitus.</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Brondy looks a lot like Wazefuk, but a lot more bulkier, curvier, and more obese. Their face has actual eyes instead of just lines, and the top-right side of their mouth has a weird stroke on it that vaguely resembles a weirdly-shaped top lip. They hate the way that look, saying it looks "archaic" as they put it, and it's caused them quite a lot of body dysmorphia.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Brondy is as if their life is on auto-pilot, not acknowledging things if they're not important or directed at them. They just wander through their life and doing what they have to do before going back to bed, like a constant state of dissociation.</p>
        <p>When something does catch their attention, they tend to just condescendingly scoff at it before re-entering their trance (e.g. Wazefuk needs something from Brondy, and they do it reluctantly, give Wazefuk a strange look, and walk away).</p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p> <!-- sorry for the extras list's HTML being so inconsistent -->
            1 - Brondy has an IQ of 147<br>
            2 - I honestly don't know how I came up with Brondy's name or what it means<br>
            3 - Brondy has depression and autism<br>
            4 - Nobody knows what the hell their deal is<br>
            5 - Brondy is definently the filler character of the main 4<br>
            6 - Brondy is intersex. They really don't like talking about it so we don't have anything to add.<br>
            7 - They were almost kicked out of the main 4 and having CakeZ replace them but that idea was cancelled
